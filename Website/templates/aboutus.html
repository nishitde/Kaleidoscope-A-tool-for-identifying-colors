    We cannot deny the fact that there is a connection between human emotions and colors. The colors affect our mood which can be proven from many episodes from our day to day lives. Especially, looking at the current situation around the globe, everybody is home for a really long time. During these times, it refreshes our memory to look back at the photos of one bright summer day all yellow, or a peaceful picnic sitting on a widely spread patch of green grass. Gazing at those colored images will give you a boost of energy on a day you would typically be running low. Therefore, instead of having to scroll through old images maybe a year old or more, we would rather just prefer to filter the images based on the color users want to perceive. So in our website, Kaleidoscope, users are able to search for the images by entering a color of their choice. So go ahead and have fun you guys!</p>
